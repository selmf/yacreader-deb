Starting with YACReader 9.0.0 we supply a systemd service file for use with
YACReaderLibraryServer. To make use of it, follow these instructions:

1. Open yacreaderlibraryserver.service in a text editor of your choice.
 Change the path used in the ExecStart variable to the location where your headless
 server binary resides. If yacreaderlibraryserver was installed as part of a
 package you can probably skip this step.

2. Copy the service file into ~/.local/share/systemd/user

3. Enable the service file by running:
 "systemctl --user enable yacreaderlibraryserver"

4. Start the server by running:
 "systemctl --user start yacreaderlibraryserver"

5. Check the server status by running:
 "systemctl --user status yacreaderlibraryserver"

Important: Don't run this as root. None of these steps require root privileges.

By the default, the service is configured to restart yacreaderlibraryserver in
case of a crash and will automatically restart even after a kill or reboot.
This might give you some trouble when running YACReaderLibrary on the same machine.

To temporarily disable the server, run systemctl with the stop command:

"systemctl --user stop yacreaderlibraryserver"

To permanently disable it, use the "disable" command:

"systemctl --user disable yacreaderlibraryserver"
