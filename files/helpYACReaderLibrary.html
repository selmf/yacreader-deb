	<h2>Usage and considerations</h2>
	<p></p>You can create a collection in any folder (write privilieges are needed). Creation process involves looking for image files in any 
	rar,zip,cbr,cbz and tar files. If images are found, the first one (alfabetically) is taken as the comic cover and added
	to the collection.</p>
	
	<p>The hidden folder .yacreaderlibrary is created in the root path of your comics folder. This folder stores
	the library with cover's tumbnails, so please, don't mess with it.</p>
	
	<p><s>.yacreaderlibrary folder can be copied in order to share your comic library with your friends. To do that, you
	can copy .yacreaderlibrary to any folder, and then "Open an existing library" from this folder (Note:
	if you update that library, all covers will be removed). Is intended that this task could be done automatically from YACReaderLibrary in a later version.</s></p>
